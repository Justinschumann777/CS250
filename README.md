1.How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I put myself in the perspective of the user, try to imagine what it like for them to use the website. 
ask myself what types of things that I would want if useing the website. I also try to get other's thoughts and opinons.
creating "user's stories" really help with imagining oneself as the user, it also given the team a good idea of what 
our intended userbase will desire from the website. 

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

   I approuch developing program like any crafter towards his intended craft. I look at what has been done before and can be improve upon.
   I also will not be scare to try something new even though it comes with a risk of failure. I also would be open to criticism from others.
   The Agile methods emphsis on adapting to change and collboration is good to incorporate in future projects. There is always something more to improve
   upon and there will be qucik and sudden changes in such a filed of work, it is to have agile in mind.
